VideoRip
================================

VideoRip is a free DVD and Blu-ray application. It doesn't do most
of the work itself. Instead it uses MakeMKV and HandBrake to automate
the process of ripping discs to the hard drive and preparing the
videos for playing. No guarantees of functionality are made with this 
software. It is an automation tool that reduces some of the manual tasks 
that must be done when ripping videos. This process is by definition
full of potential pitfalls.

Do not use VideoRip to make illegal copies of movies. The author of the
sofware is not responsible for any actions taken by users of the software
or modifications made to the software. Please use the software responsibly.

See the Setup.md for the basics of software usage and learning how to setup
your computer environment. The steps are quick and easy to accomplish. Most
of VideoRip's capability lies in the rip.bat file. Thgis file is easily editable
by anyone with a little knowledge, but the poor reliability of the Windows Batch
scripting language and Windows tools can create a lot of problems. The main
reason for using the batch scripting languages is that I started out this 
project thinking that it would be just a few lines of scripts. It kept growing!
It is not simple to translate batch scripts to another language. If anyone is
interested in translating to power shell, please let me know.

VideoRip is provided as freeware under the GNU Public License. You may not use
this software to create any program that you charge money for or earn profit from.
The main focus of VideoRip is to provide free video backup capabilities. You may 
modify the software as you lie. You are responsible for any new software that you
produce deriving from VideoRip.
